# boatwright - Boat design tools

## Limitations

  * Lots... **this is just an idea at the moment**
  * Very little documentation, one has to look at the code
  * The fairing code is not sufficiently robust

## History

This code is based on [canoe-design](https://github.com/zimeon/canoe-design) which was written in order to create the design for ["Fran"](fran), a 14.5' solo canoe for an [extended trip on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail](http://zimeon.com/2018/06/nfct). I hope to expand the scope to consider sailing boat hull shapes.
